## Currently in Development
Voiceapp is currently in development. Yet, the latest release of this project is fully functional and can be used without any major privacy-concerns.<br><br>
The next Voiceapp update will include an overall remade and refined version of this project, further improving privacy while adding features such as a a newly refined way to connect peers with each other, a peer-to-peer based, fully encrypted chat system and more!
<br><br>
Our plan is it to connect with each other while still staying fully private.
